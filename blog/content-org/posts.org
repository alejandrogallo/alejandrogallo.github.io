:END:

So, the other day doing dumpster diving I found an interesting piece
of history, here are some crappy shots I took

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:/blog/images/acris/38.jpg]]

#+attr_html: :width 500px

[[file:/blog/images/acris/42.jpg]]

At first while in the dumpster I thought they switches
where some kind of KPT switches I saw once online, to my surprise
after desoldering the switches I found out they were actually
~Tec~ switches and the only information I could find online was
in [[https://deskthority.net/wiki/TEC_switch][deskthority]].

Here is a show of the bare board without the keycps

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:/blog/images/acris/9.jpg]]

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:/blog/images/acris/6.jpg]]

and to my delight the keycaps turned out to be double-shot, in very
nice shape after a thorough clean-up

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:/blog/images/acris/44.jpg]]

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:/blog/images/acris/58.jpg]]

The switches are clicky and quite frankly not so good.
I have to say while in the board they sounded better, but in the
actual project they lost the hollow sound, but still.
You can hear [[file:/blog/images/acris/5.mp4][here]] how it sounded.

Anyways I wanted to build something with them, so I set out
to build a quick [[https://atreus.technomancy.us/][atreus]]-like keyboard but in split-mode.

In the future I want to tweak the layouts so I wanted
to have a simple a nice format for the coordinates
of every key and no existing solutions quite fit my needs.
I've been a fan of [[https://asymptote.sourceforge.io][asymptote]] for many years
but the language and the libraries haven't quite convinced me,
so I wrote a haskell script to do this using the excellent
[[https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/manual.html][diagrams]] library.

The result is in [[https://github.com/alejandrogallo/split-atreus][this repository]]. To do quickly a keyboard without
many tools I just bought some thin wood sheets and created
the first test for the layout:

[[file:/blog/images/acris/Nammu-Tec-left.svg]]

In principle the idea is to drill holes where the *three*
switch's legs are and glue the bottom of the switch to the
wood (yes, I know is not the best way to go but well, at least
I'm recycling).

Here I am punching holes into the wood to have a guide
for the *hand drill*

#+attr_html: :width 500px
file:/blog/images/acris/100.jpg

and after much work, this is what I got

#+attr_html: :width 500px
file:/blog/images/acris/62.jpg
#+attr_html: :width 500px
file:/blog/images/acris/61.jpg

which in total ends up looking like this

#+attr_html: :width 500px
file:/blog/images/acris/4.jpg

#+attr_html: :width 500px
file:/blog/images/acris/11.jpg

Although we are almost there, it is not over.
It is not so nice to leave the sides open to dust
and other inconvenients, so I would like to cover them.
I bought some 3mm wood sticks to cover the sides
by gluing them together and some plexiglass to
have the front panel be able to shine light through.

Here you see the raw material and I cut
myself a bit cutting this plexiglass,
so be careful!

#+attr_html: :width 500px
file:/blog/images/acris/photo5339261905551863206.jpg

Next time I will document better the process of
gluing everything together and so on, but since it was
so messy I kind of forget.
After sanding the edges it is a fair enough result.

And that's all, if I find time and people are interested
I will at some point write a tutorial of how
to write from scratch a

a hand-wired split keyboard.

* Getting paper references with papis                                 :papis:
:PROPERTIES:

:EXPORT_DATE: [2020-12-06 Sun]
:END:

Today I would like to talk about how I normally
download references of papers using
the tool [[https://github.com/papis/papis][Papis]].
I will be writing in the future more posts about
this tool and about how it makes my life easier.

Usually when I am researching a topic and
I read a paper about it, I want to check out some references
cited in the paper.
However, I find it very tiresome to copy the reference
or the link (if any is available in the pdf),
paste it in the browser and download it with papis.
I mean, this is still ok, and sometimes I do exactly this.
But most of the times, I can do better, and I want to
tell you exactly how.

To see how this works we are going to work with the following
landmark paper:


#+begin_src bibtex :exports code :results nil
@article{Theory.of.SuperBardee1957,
  author = {Bardeen, J. and Cooper, L. N. and Schrieffer, J. R.},
  doi = {10.1103/PhysRev.108.1175},
  issue = {5},
  journal = {Physical Review},
  pages = {1175--1204},
  title = {Theory of Superconductivity},
  url = {http://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRev.108.1175},
  volume = {108},
  year = {1957},
}
#+end_src

Right now when papis adds a paper through the
~doi~ importer, i.e., when you do something like

#+begin_src shell
papis add --from doi 10.1103/PhysRev.108.1175
#+end_src
or simply
#+begin_src shell
papis add 10.1103/PhysRev.108.1175
#+end_src

you get information similar to the following
in the ~info.yaml~ file

#+begin_src yaml

Take a look at the ~citations~ section,
we get a list of *most* ~doi~ strings referenced in the paper.

Papis has a command called ~explore~ which offers much functionality.
One of the subcommands of ~explore~ is called ~citations~, so that
you can explore the citations in the ~citations~ field of your
info file.
Since explore commands are quite long, I normally define
a ~bash~ function or an alias to use them.
In this case I define the following function in my
[[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129143/what-is-the-purpose-of-bashrc-and-how-does-it-work][~/.bashrc]] file


#+begin_src sh
citget() {
  query=$1
  shift
  papis explore citations -s "$query" pick cmd "papis add --from doi {doc[doi]} $@"
}
#+end_src

If this seems like a magic incantation to you, let us break it down.
The help message of the ~citations~ command reads like
#+begin_src sh :exports both :results verbatim :cache yes
papis explore citations -h
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[740ff5551d4bd728d249bb17512fa17cdc1af2d2]:
#+begin_example
Usage: papis explore citations [OPTIONS] [QUERY]

  Query the citations of a paper

  Example:

  Go through the citations of a paper and export it in a yaml file

      papis explore citations 'einstein' export --format yaml einstein.yaml

Options:
  --doc-folder PATH            Apply action to a document path
  -h, --help                   Show this message and exit.
  -s, --save                   Store the citations in the document's folder
                               for later use

  --rmfile                     Remove the stored citations file
  -m, --max-citations INTEGER  Number of citations to be retrieved
#+end_example

The flag ~-s~ means that the citations downloaded should be stored in
a ~citations.yaml~ file in the document's folder.
Whichever citation we then choose, we will pass it to the
~cmd~ command, which accepts a string that will be run in the shell. In this case,
we select a cited document and apply the ~papis add --from doi {doc[doi]}~
format, which replaces the ~{doc[doi]}~ part in the format string by
the ~doi~ of the selected document.

Here you can see it in action, it first
checks if a citation ~doi~ is already in the library,
in which case the information is already there.
If the ~doi~ of the citation is not in our library,
then the infomation gets downloaded via [[http://crossref.org][crossref]].

** Introduction
This document explains in a pedagogical way how to write
a simple music/video bookmark player with the programming language [[https://raku.org][raku]].

I often find myself discovering nice music on youtube and wanting to recover
or replay it later.
Of course I could use a bookmark manager but I want an easy fuzzy searching
and storing the links in an [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] file.

Instead of writing quickly the script and adding it to my script collections, 
I thought this time I can show how convenient and fun ~raku~ can be in scripting
these kind of small applications.

Do not worry if you don't understand everything here, it is also meant as
a teaser so that you go and learn some raku yourself! I think that raku at least
for scripting is highly underrated.

So let's get to it!

** Main

Raku lets you define a ~MAIN~ function globally where your program starts.
I like to do this in simple scripts and then it's out of the way.

#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref main-script
#| A simple playlist manager
unit sub MAIN();
#+end_src

Notice that just with this line your application already has an argument parser
predefined, i.e., if I name the script =,yt=, as I have, then

#+begin_src sh :eval no
,yt -h
#+end_src

results in

#+begin_example
Usage:
  ,yt -- A simple playlist manager
#+end_example

You can do much more with this default parser, but for our simple script we do not need it.

In my case, I will store the links to the songs or playlists in an =org-mode= file,
in your case you might decide otherwise.

I will store the location to my org file in the constant
=$ORG_LINK_FILE=:
#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref main-script
constant $ORG_LINK_FILE = "%*ENV<HOME>/.config/org/yt-playlists.org";
#+end_src

** Links
We would like to parse the =org-mode= links appearing in the playlist file,
an /named/ =org-mode= link looks like this

#+begin_src text
[[URL][My long and complicated title]]
#+end_src

Let us define a ~Link~ data structure in a class

#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref main-script
class Link {
  has Str $.name;
  has Str $.url;
  has Str $.tags;
}
#+end_src

Raku has Regexes and Grammars as first-class citizens in the language, let us define a
simple regex for an ~org-mode~ link

#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref main-script
my regex org-mode-link {
  "[["
    $<url> = <-[\]]>+
  "]["
    $<name> = <-[\]]>+
  "]]"
}
#+end_src

notice how convenient it is to define a named regular expression in raku.
=$<url>= and =$<name>= are a named-captures that will be helpful later on,
for more information consult the [[https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#index-entry-declarator_regex-Subrules][raku documentation]].

However, in general I will have my url in a section's header, and in =org-mode=
you can add tags to headers. Therefore I would also like to parse these tags
so that I can match the titles easier, the general form of a title
in ~org-mode~ is

#+begin_src text
 * [[url][My long and complicated title]]                            :some:tags:
#+end_src

A simple regular expression matching the tags **for our purposes** is simply

#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref main-script
my regex org-tags {
  ":" .* ":" $$
}
#+end_src

where ~$$~ denotes the end of a line.


** Picking with dmenu
We will be using [[http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][dmenu]] as a pick tool, so we should write
a function that accepts a list of links and asks for user input
via dmenu returning a list of selected links.

We can define a function in raku using the ~sub~ keyword,
so in our case the function would look like this

#+begin_src raku :noweb no-export :noweb-ref main-script
sub dmenu-link (Link @links) of Array[Link] {
  <<dmenu-title>>
  <<dmenu-link-contents>>
}
#+end_src

This says, accept as an argument a list of ~Link~ and return an ~Array~
of ~Link~.

We can define an duck-typed helper function that takes 
a ~Link~ as an input and returns the text that ~dmenu~ will
see and offer to the user, in raku we can simply write

=<<dmenu-title>>==
#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref dmenu-title :tangle no
my &dmenu-title = {"{.name} {.tags}"};
#+end_src

In order to feed the text to dmenu we can create a temporary
file where we will put all the titles of the entries
and then feed to the dmenu process its contents through
the ~stdin~ file descriptor:

=<<dmenu-link-contents>>==
#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref dmenu-link-contents :tangle no
with "/tmp/,yt.in".IO.open: :rw {
  .say: @links».&dmenu-title.join: "\n";
  .close and .open; # we need to close and open, maybe improve?
  my Str $name = .out.slurp.chomp
                  given shell "dmenu -i", :in($_), :out;
  Array[Link].new: @links.grep: {.&dmenu-title eq $name}
}
#+end_src


** Parsing the ~org-mode~ link file

Let us define the function that will parse the org file and return an =Array= of links.
In this function we use the [[https://docs.raku.org/syntax/gather%20take][=gather=]] syntax provided by raku, which simplifies
in this case the building of the resulting array.

Essentially, we simply go through the lines of =$ORG_LINK_FILE=
and =take= a =Link= only when the line matches

=<<parse-org-regex>>==
#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref parse-org-regex :tangle no
<org-mode-link> [\s+ <org-tags>]?
#+end_src

Notice that in raku we can trigger the evaluation of a code
whenever a regular expression matches by
embedding the code inside the regular expression in a code block.
In this case this looks like this:

=<<parse-links-regex>>==
#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref parse-links-regex :tangle no :noweb no-export
/ <<parse-org-regex>>
  { take
      Link.new: |hash
        <name url tags>
        Z=>
        ( |$<org-mode-link><name url>
        , $<org-tags>
        )».&{.so ?? .Str !! ""}
  }
/
#+end_src

If this seems like [[https://www.perl.com/pub/2000/01/10PerlMyths.html/#Perl_looks_like_line_noise][line noise]] to you, it is normal and I am sorry.
However, I think it is part of the fun writing and learning raku.
Of course one should write differently if it is meant to be understood
by everyone in a team, but for your private short scripts like this one
you may experiment with what the language has to offer.
However, you can go **way** wilder than this..
I'll leave it as an exercise to decipher this bit!

With this, our parsing function looks simply like:

#+begin_src raku :noweb no-export :noweb-ref def-parse-link
sub parse-links (--> Array[Link]) {
  Array[Link].new:
    gather
      for $ORG_LINK_FILE.IO.lines {
        .match:
        <<parse-links-regex>>
      }
}
#+end_src

or expanding all the code to see it in full

#+begin_src raku :noweb yes :tangle no :noweb-ref main-script
<<def-parse-link>>
#+end_src


** Play the music!

We will be playing the videos and playlists with
[[https://mpv.io/][mpv]] which uses [[https://youtube-dl.org/][youtube-dl]] to stream the content directly.
A very simple function to play a ~Link~ will be

#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref main-script
sub play-with-mpv (Link $l) {
  say "Playing {$l.name}";
  shell "mpv '{$l.url}'";
}
#+end_src

and therefore the main program is simply given by

#+begin_src raku :noweb-ref main-script
.&play-with-mpv
  for dmenu-link parse-links;
#+end_src

Notice that in raku one can call a function in this way too,
akin to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax][the uniform function call syntax]], so the following
two calls to =&my-function= are equivalent, i.e., they print
=Hello world=:
#+begin_src raku :tangle no
my &my-function = &say o (* ~ " world");
my-function "Hello";
"Hello".&my-function;
#+end_src


** Putting it all together

#+headers: :shebang #!/usr/bin/env raku
#+headers: :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
#+headers: :tangle ~/.dotfiles/bin/,yt
#+begin_src raku :noweb yes
#!/usr/bin/env raku
<<main-script>>
#+end_src


* Install maxima to use in common lisp                          :lisp:maxima:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: install-maxima-in-common-lisp
:EXPORT_DATE: [2022-09-03 Thu]
:END:

One of the nice things of common lisp is that it allows you to use
very high quality libraries like [[https://maxima.sourceforge.io/][maxima]].
It might not be clear for everyone how to install [[https://maxima.sourceforge.io/][maxima]] in an easy
way to use from common lisp maybe through quicklisp.
This short post shows just a way of doing it.

In principle you can just clone the [[https://maxima.sourceforge.io/][maxima]] repository
and compile it like an autotools project, provided you pass
to the configure script the lisp implementation that you are going to use.
So for instance if we cloned the [[https://git.code.sf.net/p/maxima/code][maxima repo]] to =$folder=
we would just do

#+begin_src sh
test -x configure || ./bootstrap
./configure --with-sbcl=sbcl
make
#+end_src

Then at least with [[https://sbcl.org][sbcl]] everything should work.
We can now link the directory to the default =~/common-lisp=
directory

#+begin_src sh
ln -frs $folder ~/common-lisp/maxima
#+end_src

and then from a common lisp shell it is even =quickloadable=

#+begin_src sh
CL-USER> (ql:quickload 'maxima)
To load "maxima":
  Load 1 ASDF system:
    maxima
; Loading "maxima"
[package pregexp].................................
[package cl-info].................................
[package command-line]............................
[package getopt]..................................
[package cl-sloop]................................
[package maxima]..................................
[package mt19937].................................
[package bigfloat-impl]...........................
[package bigfloat]................................
[package intl]....................................
..................................................
..................................................
..................................................
[package f2cl-lib]................................
[package slatec]..................................
..................................................
etc..
#+end_src

Now you can do nice things like expanding expressions
and so on, for instance you can use the
=#$ expr $= reader macro to build up maxima expressions

#+begin_src lisp :exports both :results verbatim
(in-package :maxima)
(let ((e #$ expand((a + b + c) ^ 2) $))
  e)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ((MPLUS SIMP) ((MEXPT SIMP) $A 2) ((MTIMES SIMP) 2 $A $B) ((MEXPT SIMP) $B 2)
:  ((MTIMES SIMP) 2 $A $C) ((MTIMES SIMP) 2 $B $C) ((MEXPT SIMP) $C 2))


and you can use a host of maxima functions written in lisp or write
maxima functions and call them from lisp, for instance,

#+begin_src lisp :exports both :results verbatim
(in-package :maxima)
(let ((e #$ f(a, b, c) := expand((a + b + c) ^ 2) $))
  (mcall '$f 1 1 1))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 9 (4 bits, #x9, #o11, #b1001)


I hope this helps you get started, certainly it would have helped me!


** The script

#+begin_src sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

url=https://git.code.sf.net/p/maxima/code
folder="$HOME/software/maxima"

install_maxima () {

** How it works

Many people often ask me how I generated the QRCode for my Wireless
network, so I decided to write this for them.
Nowadays it is quite often that the routers come with the QRcode already
baked in or they provide ways of generating the QRcode through their
admin webiste. However not everyone is able to easily access to the router
admin page or maybe some other websites on the internet are full of ads or are
simply too slow.
That is why I provide here this minimal functionality with an explanation.

The above QRCode simply encodes a special string that the application that
is scanning understands. Let us suppose that your wireless network
is called *Homer* and the password is *123456789*, then the QRCode simply
encodes the following text

#+begin_example
WIFI:S:Homer;T:WPA;P:123456789;;
#+end_example

Therefore, this website is just a helping tool for you to convert
this piece of text into an image, that your camera app can then read
and maybe it recognises that the text starts with the word =WIFI=
and logs you in automatically.
