#+title: Building a split keyboard with recycled switches
#+date: 27 September 2020

So, the other day doing dumpster diving I found an interesting piece
of history, here are some crappy shots I took

At first while in the dumpster I thought they switches
where some kind of KPT switches I saw once online, to my surprise
after desoldering the switches I found out they were actually
~Tec~ switches and the only information I could find online was
in [[https://deskthority.net/wiki/TEC_switch][deskthority]].

Here is a show of the bare board without the keycps

and to my delight the keycaps turned out to be double-shot, in very
nice shape after a thorough clean-up

The switches are clicky and quite frankly not so good.
I have to say while in the board they sounded better, but in the
actual project they lost the hollow sound, but still.
You can hear [[file:5.mp4][here]] how it sounded.

Anyways I wanted to build something with them, so I set out
to build a quick [[https://atreus.technomancy.us/][atreus]]-like keyboard but in split-mode.

In the future I want to tweak the layouts so I wanted
to have a simple a nice format for the coordinates
of every key and no existing solutions quite fit my needs.
I've been a fan of [[https://asymptote.sourceforge.io][asymptote]] for many years
but the language and the libraries haven't quite convinced me,
so I wrote a haskell script to do this using the excellent
[[https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/manual.html][diagrams]] library.

The result is in [[https://github.com/alejandrogallo/split-atreus][this repository]]. To do quickly a keyboard without
many tools I just bought some thin wood sheets and created
the first test for the layout:

In principle the idea is to drill holes where the *three*
switch's legs are and glue the bottom of the switch to the
wood (yes, I know is not the best way to go but well, at least
I'm recycling).

Here I am punching holes into the wood to have a guide
for the *hand drill*

and after much work, this is what I got

which in total ends up looking like this
