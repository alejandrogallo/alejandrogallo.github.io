      <description>Introduction This document explains in a pedagogical way how to write a simple music/video bookmark player with the programming language raku.
I often find myself discovering nice music on youtube and wanting to recover or replay it later. Of course I could use a bookmark manager but I want an easy fuzzy searching and storing the links in an org-mode file.
Instead of writing quickly the script and adding it to my script collections, I thought this time I can show how convenient and fun raku can be in scripting these kind of small applications.</description>

      <description>Today I would like to talk about how I normally download references of papers using the tool Papis. I will be writing in the future more posts about this tool and about how it makes my life easier.
Usually when I am researching a topic and I read a paper about it, I want to check out some references cited in the paper. However, I find it very tiresome to copy the reference or the link (if any is available in the pdf), paste it in the browser and download it with papis.</description>

      <description>So, the other day doing dumpster diving I found an interesting piece of history, here are some crappy shots I took
At first while in the dumpster I thought they switches where some kind of KPT switches I saw once online, to my surprise after desoldering the switches I found out they were actually Tec switches and the only information I could find online was in deskthority.
Here is a show of the bare board without the keycps</description>
