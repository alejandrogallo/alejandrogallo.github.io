* About me

My name is Alejandro Gallo and I am currently
a physicist at the Technical University of Vienna
[[https://cqc.itp.tuwien.ac.at]].
I am currently pursuing a PhD in theoretical
physics in the field of condensed matter.

* Projects
I enjoy building things, be it on the computer or with my hands.
Maybe check out my github profile for some examples [[https://github.com/alejandrogallo][here]].
- I am the main author and maintainer of [[https://github.com/papis/papis][papis]].
- I try to optimize my keyboard layout
  in [[https://github.com/alejandrogallo/split-atreus/][the split keyboard lab]].
- I build my own [[https://github.com/alejandrogallo/dikis][dictionaries]] for [[https://github.com/alejandrogallo/python-milon][hebrew]] and [[https://github.com/alejandrogallo/aramorph][arabic]].


* Music
- I had much fun playing in Baasztian's album
  [[https://baasztian.bandcamp.com/album/diagnose-chronisch-ironisch][diagnose: chronisch ironisch]].
- I released a demo back in 2006 called *Open 24 Hours*
  under the artistic name of *Nango*, you can check out the bandcamp
  [[https://nango.bandcamp.com][here]].
